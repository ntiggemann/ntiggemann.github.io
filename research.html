        <h2>Research</h2>
        I am currently working on applications of k-phase structures, a concept I introduced in my Master's thesis. They are closely related to 
        quadratic enrichments of tropical varieties, roughly said they place the same information on the variety instead of "between" the facets.
        <p>
            <h3>Master's thesis - k-phase structures</h3>
            In my Master's thesis I generalized real phase structures, which are defined over the real numbers, to arbitrary fields. A k-phase 
            stores additional information to the valuation of a Puiseux-series, it collects the "sign" of the leading coefficient. These stores
            satisfy a "balancing condition". You can find the pdf <a href="MT.pdf">here</a>. There are a few new remarks and subsections compared
            to the text I handed in, the changes are noted in the beginning.
            <h3>Bachelor's thesis - About the Tropicalization of the
                Catalecticant and the Lüroth
                Invariant</h3>
            As the title suggests, in my Bachelor's thesis I considered the Catalecticant and Lüroth invariant and studied how they behave
            under tropicalization. In particular, I studied how their properties "invariant vanishes implies the polynomial has a property" behaved for their 
            Tropicalization. The results were mostly negative. You can find my Bachelor's thesis <a href="BT.pdf">here</a>.<br>
            As this was my first contact with tropical geometry, this text also includes a short introduction into tropical geometry. Moreover, in the 
            appendix you can find a horribly inefficient MatLab code for plotting tropical curves. Over at <a href="coding.html">coding</a> you can find
            a way better and faster python script for that.
