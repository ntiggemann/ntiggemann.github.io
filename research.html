        <h2>Research</h2>
        I am currently working on applications of k-phase structures, a concept I introduced in my Master's thesis. They are closely related to 
        quadratic enrichments of tropical varieties. Roughly, they place the same information, the "signs" of the preimages under valuation, 
        on the variety instead of "between" the facets.

            <h3 id="k-phase_structures">Master's thesis - k-phase structures</h3>
            In my Master's thesis, I generalized real phase structures, which are defined over the real numbers, to arbitrary fields. A k-phase 
            stores additional information to the valuation of a Puiseux-series, it collects the "signs" of the leading coefficients. These 
            satisfy a "balancing condition". You can find the PDF <a href="MT.pdf">here</a>. There are a few new remarks and subsections compared
            to the text I handed in, the changes are noted in the beginning.
            <h3>Bachelor's thesis - About the Tropicalization of the
                Catalecticant and the Lüroth
                Invariant</h3>
            As the title suggests, in my Bachelor's thesis, I considered the Catalecticant and Lüroth invariant and studied how they behave
            under tropicalization. In particular, I studied how their properties "invariant vanishes implies the polynomial has a property" behaved for their 
            tropicalization. The results were mostly negative. You can find my Bachelor's thesis <a href="BT.pdf">here</a>.<br>
            As this was my first contact with tropical geometry, this text also includes a short introduction into tropical geometry. Moreover, in the 
            appendix you can find a horribly inefficient MatLab code for plotting tropical curves. Over at <a href="coding.html">coding</a>, you can find
            a way better and faster Python script for that.
